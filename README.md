### Hi there

👋 My name is Mike Zimin.
I am a passionate developer with experience in python, с, php and js / typescript.
I'm currently focused on python and diving into rust.  

I mostly write commercial code, but here are some open source projects I've done in my spare time:

- (python internals) - extension for cpython, written in C, which allows you to explore and visualize in runtime the representation of python objects in the form of cpython structs.
  
- (miel) - microframework that works with any ASGI server.

👯 I am ready to contribute to **python extension** projects that have **rust** under the hood.

💬 Ask me about python (cpython) internals
