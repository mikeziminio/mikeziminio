### Hi there

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mike Zimin.

I am a passionate developer with experience in Python, C, PHP and JavaScript / TypeScript.

**I'm currently focused on Python and diving into the Rust.**

I mostly write commercial code, but here are some open source projects that I have launched and support in my spare time:

---

#### [python internals](https://github.com/mikeziminio/python-internals)
Extension for cpython, written in C, which allows you to explore and visualize in runtime the representation of python objects in the form of cpython C-structs.

---

#### [miel](https://github.com/mikeziminio/miel)
HTTP / WebSocket microframework that works with any ASGI server.

---

#### [LenguaSim](https://github.com/mikeziminio/lengua-sim)
Language coach simulator (with stdio and telegram bot interfaces) and OpenAI and Google TextToSpeech API battaries under the hood.

---

ðŸ‘¯ I am ready to contribute to **python extension** projects that have **rust** under the hood.
