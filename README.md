### Hi there

üëã My name is Mike Zimin.

I am a passionate developer with experience in Python, C, PHP and JavaScript / TypeScript.

**I am currently focused on Python and diving into the Rust.**

I mostly write commercial code, but here are some open source projects that I have launched and support in my spare time:
