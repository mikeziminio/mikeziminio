### Hi there

üëã My name is Mike Zimin.
I am a passionate developer with experience in python, —Å, php and js / typescript.

I'm currently focused on python and diving into rust.  

I mostly write commercial code, but here are some open source projects I've done in my spare time:

---

#### [python internals](https://github.com/mikeziminio/python-internals)
Extension for cpython, written in C, which allows you to explore and visualize in runtime the representation of python objects in the form of cpython structs.

---

#### [miel](https://github.com/mikeziminio/miel)
http / websocket microframework that works with any ASGI server.

---

üëØ I am ready to contribute to **python extension** projects that have **rust** under the hood.
